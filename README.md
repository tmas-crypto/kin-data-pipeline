# kin-data-pipeline
Open source repo for the Kin data warehouse models and supporting scripts to manage pipeline ops.

Note: This is intended to be run through a Hyperplane image using Shakudo. Likely extensible to any hosted infrastructure with a bit of refactoring.

Data warehouse being used is Snowflake.
